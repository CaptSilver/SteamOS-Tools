# TODO items
* Configure setup-wine.game.sh to check for pre-requisite packages (e.g. POL)
* Configure setup-wine.game.sh to load variables from user input
* Configure setup-wine.game.sh to handle potential issues / user error
* Write any post install scripts
* Testing, testing, and more testing

# Notes
* Configurations / skeleton files will be properly located at cfgs/playonlinux/*
* Multiple game templates can be held in cfgs/playonlinux for those that may not fit under the "wine game loader"
* Possible plans to not just handle Windows Steam games under Wine, but other non-Steam games / applications
* scriptmodules/wine-utils.shinc will hold the main functions of the "wine loader" and other items
